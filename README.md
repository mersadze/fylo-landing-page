# Frontend Mentor - Fylo Landing Page (Two Column Layout)

This is my solution to the [Fylo landing page with two column layout challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout-5ca5ef041e82137ec91a50f5). It helped me practice responsive layout, mobile-first design, and semantic HTML structure.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the site properly across different device screen sizes
- See hover states on all interactive elements

## ðŸ›  My Process

### ðŸ§± Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** custom properties
- **Flexbox**
- **Mobile-first** workflow
- Responsive design using media queries

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

This project helped me:

- Improve my understanding of **mobile-first design**
- Practice clean layout using **Flexbox**
- Understand how to use relative units like `rem`, `em`, `%` instead of fixed `px` values for responsiveness
- Spot and fix layout issues using **Chrome Dev Tools**

```css
.hero-section {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .hero-section {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”„ Continued Development

I want to get better at:

- Creating **perfectly balanced layouts** on any screen
